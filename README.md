# SignSpeak-Project
SignSpeak is a real-time gesture recognition and text-to-speech system using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and TensorFlow. It tracks hand gestures, recognizes them via a trained CNN model, and converts them into speech. The project includes a GUI and supports custom datasets. Continuous updates improve accuracy, performance, and gesture support.
